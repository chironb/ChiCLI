user interface
---------------------------------------
tEXT eNTRY

cHIcli USES CUSTOM ROUTINES TO
MANAGE THE INPUT AND EDITING OF TEXT
ON THE COMMAND LINE. iT AUTOMATICALLY
INSERTS CHARACTERS, AND SUPPORTS 
BACKSPACE AND DELETE. iT ALSO SUPPORTS
CURSOR KEYS AND A HOME AND END KEYS.

tHE cOMMODORE CURSOR KEYS ARE SUPPORTED
AS WELL AS EXTRA KEYS TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING FROM THE
lINUX OR wINDOWS KEYBOARD LAYOUTS.

nOTE: 
del AND home ARE TREATED THE SAME.

cursor-left ctrl+j - cURSOR lEFT
cursor-left ctrl+l - cURSOR rIGHT
cursor-up   ctrl+i - lAST eNTERED tEXT
cursor-down ctrl+k - eRASE lINE

del ctrl+h         - bACKSPACE
shift+del ctrl+:   - fORWARD dELETE

ctrl+u             - sTART OF lINE
ctrl+o             - eND OF lINE

runstop ctrl+c     - cANCELS INPUT
---------------------------------------
tAB cOMPLETION

cOMMODORE 64: uSE ctrl+lEFT-aRROW

oN THE cOMMODORE 64 THERE IS NO tab 
KEY ON THE KEYBOARD. tHE CLOSEST IS THE
left arrow KEY ABOVE THE ctrl KEY AT 
THE FAR LEFT OF THE KEYBOARD. 

iN ORDER TO ENTER A LEFT ARROW 
CHARACTER, FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU NEED TO 
LOAD A FILE NAME THAT CONTAINS THE 
LEFT ARROW CHARACTER, YOU CAN PRESS:
left arrow 
TO ENTER THIS CHARACTER.

tHE TAB COMPLETION WILL START SEARCHING
THE CURRENT FOLDER FOR FILES WHOSE
BEGINNING MATCH THE LAST STRING OF 
TEXT ENTERED ON THE COMMAND LINE THAT'S
SEPARATED BY AN EMPTY SPACE. 

pLEASE NOTE: i'VE MADE THIS WAY FASTER
NOW. hOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE AN sd2iec 
WITH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF FILES, IT'S
GOING TO TAKE TIME TO LOAD EACH FILE 
NAME AND COMPARE IT TO THE TEXT YOU'RE
TRYING TO AUTO-COMPLETE.
---------------------------------------
hOTKEYS

hOTKEY MANAGES THE ABILITY TO ASSIGN
COMMAND STRINGS TO THE FUNCTION KEYS. 

eXAMPLES:
HOTKEY                  - lISTS HOTKEYS
HOTKEY 1 "ECHO hI!"     - aSSIGNS f1
HOTKEY 2 LS             - aSSIGNS f2
HOTKEY 1 -CLEAR         - cLEARS f1
HOTKEY -CLEAR           - cLEARS ALL

yOU CAN ALSO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE
COMPLEX LIKE THIS: 

HOTKEY 1 = "ECHO ;cHIcli rULES!;"

tHE SEMI-COLON IS AUTOMATICALLY 
SUBSTITUTED FOR QUOTES WHEN THE SYSTEM
PROCESSES THE ECHO COMMAND. 
---------------------------------------
aLIASES

aLIAS MANAGED THE ALIASING SYSTEM. yOU
CAN SET YOUR OWN, CLEAR THEM, OR CLEAR
ALL OF THE ALIASES. 

tHERE ARE A NUMBER OF PRE-CONFIGURED 
ALIASES ALREADY SET, BASED ON COMMANDS
FROM cOMMODORE dos, aMIGAdos, ms-dos,
AND lINUX.

ALIAS                 - lISTS ALIASES
ALIAS HI "ECHO hI!"   - sETS AN ALIAS
ALIAS VM VIEW-MEM     - sETS AN ALIAS
ALIAS VM -CLEAR       - cLEARS AN ALIAS
ALIAS -CLEAR          - cLEARS ALL

ALIAS CR = "ECHO ;cHIcli rULES!;"

tHE SEMI-COLON IS AUTOMATICALLY 
SUBSTITUTED FOR QUOTES WHEN THE SYSTEM
PROCESSES THE ECHO COMMAND.
---------------------------------------
aRGUMENTS

cHIcli SUPPORTS ARGUMENTS PASSED BY
cOMMODORE bASIC.

iT USES THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
run:rem arg1 "arg2 quoted" arg3 "" arg5

sUPPORTED OPTIONS:

dISABLE dRIVE dETECT: -DDD

tHIS DISABLED DRIVE DETECTION. tHIS IS
ALSO DISABLED ONCE YOU CHANGE DRIVE 
NUMBERS IN SOFTWARE. iN THE FUTURE, 
THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED DIFFERENTLY. 

eXAMPLE:
load"chicli",8
run:rem -ddd

sKIP tITLE: -SKIPTITLE OR -ST

tHIS SKIPS THE HARDWARE SCREEN GETS 
YOU TO THE PROMPT FASTER. tHIS IS ALSO 
CREATED FOR EXTERNAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE 
LAUNCHED FROM IT AND THEN RE-LOAD AND 
RE-RUN IT, CREATED A MORE SEAMLESS 
EXPERIENCE. 

eXAMPLE FROM bASIC:
load"chicli",8
run:rem -st

eXAMPLE FROM WITHIN cHIcli:
./CHICLI -ST
RUN CHICLI -ST
---------------------------------------
commands
---------------------------------------
./ cOMMAND

tHIS LOADS AND RUNS A COMMAND AFTER
EXITING THE cHIcli SYSTEM. tHIS DOESN'T
WORK WITH AUTOCOMPLETE.

tHE WAS CREATED WITH THE ASSUMPTION
THAT EXTERNAL COMMANDS WILL BE CREATED
TO WORK WITH cHIcli. tHE INTENTION IS
THAT AN EXTERNAL COMMAND OR PROGRAM
COULD BE CALLED, AND PASSED ARGUMENTS,
AND THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD THEN RUN
cHIcli IN A SPECIAL MODE THAT DOESN'T
CLEAR THE SCREEN AND DISPLAY THE OUTPUT
OF SYSINFO.

fOR A DETAILED EXAMPLE, i'D LIKE TO
EVENTUALLY CREATE cHIeDIT, WHICH IS A
TEXT EDITOR PROGRAM TO COMPLIMENT
cHIcli. iF YOU WANTED TO USE IT, YOU
WOULD TYPE:

./CHIEDIT SOME-FILE.TXT

...AND THIS WOULD START THE TEXT
EDITOR AND OPEN THE SOME-FILE.TXT FILE
FOR EDITING. tHEN, ONCE YOU'VE FINISHED
AND SAVED THE FILE, AND THEN EXITED
THE PROGRAM, THE PROGRAM WOULD KNOW
THAT IT WAS CALLED FROM WITHIN cHIcli
AND AUTOMATICALLY RUN cHIcli AGAIN,
BUT THIS TIME WITHOUT THE SYSINFO
TITLE SCREEN.

yOU CAN ALSO USE THIS WITH ANY PROGRAM
YOU'D LIKE, HOWEVER, YOU MIGHT HAVE
TO USE THE "RUN" COMMAND INSTEAD, IF
FOR SOME REASON THE PROGRAM DOESN'T
WORK PROPERLY WHEN CALLED USING THE
"./" METHOD.

aLTHOUGH THIS LOOKS LIKE A VERY unix
OR posix METHOD, IT'S JUST A COMMAND
WITH THE NAME "./" AND DOESN'T WORK
WITH COMPLEX PATHS. iT MAY SUPPORT
THIS IN THE FUTURE. tHE REASON YOU
CAN'T JUST CALL A FILE BY IT'S NAME,
AS YOU WOULD IN ms-dos, IS THAT WOULD
INVOLVE SCANNING THE ENTIRE CURRENT
DIRECTORY FOR prg FILES THAT CAN
ACTUALLY BE EXECUTED. tHIS WOULD TAKE
TOO LONG ON SLOW DRIVES AND MAKE THE
WHOLE OF cHIcli LESS RESPONSIVE.
---------------------------------------
= maths command

mATHS: tHE EQUALS COMMAND LETS YOU DO 
VERY SIMPLE CALCULATIONS. iT'S LIMITED 
TO INTEGERS AND ONLY TWO TERMS AND THE

aLL TIME AND DATE HANDLING BY cHIcli
IS DONE ON THE sd2iec DEVICE
EXCLUSIVELY.

sOME VERSIONS OF THE sd2iec, DEPENDING
ON HARDWARE OR FIRMWARE, HAVE A CLOCK
BUILT INTO THE DEVICE. oNE VERSION HAS
A SOFTWARE CLOCK THAT ONLY OPERATES
WHILE THE DEVICE IS POWERED. oNCE IT IS
POWERED OFF THE DATE AND TIME ARE LOST.

hOWEVER, THERE ARE VERSIONS OF THE
sd2iec THAT HAVE, OR CAN BE UPGRADED,
WITH A REAL-TIME CLOCK (rtc).

cHIcli SUPPORTS BOTH. yOU CAN VIEW
THE DATE AND TIME, AND EVEN SET THE
CLOCK, ALL WITHOUT LEAVING THE
ENVIRONMENT.

tHE VERSIONS THAT SUPPORT SOME FORM OF
A CLOCK, ALSO AUTOMATICALLY SAVE THE
TIME STAMP WHEN FILES ARE CREATED OR
MODIFIED ON THE sd CARD OF THE sd2iec.

aLSO SEE THE 'FILEDATE' COMMAND,
AS IT ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK-UP A GIVEN
FILE NAME AND GET IT'S TIME STAMP.

dos command

tHIS LETS YOU EXECUTE A CUSTOM COMMAND
INTENDED FOR A cOMMODORE dos DEVICE.
iT EXPECTS A SECOND ARGUMENT TO BE THE
COMMAND TO SEND TO THE CURRENTLY
SELECTED DRIVE. iT USES THE COMMAND
CHANNEL 1. iT PASSES THE GIVEN STRING
DIRECTLY TO THE cOMMODORE dos DEVICE.

nOTE: rEMEMBER THAT MOST EXAMPLES ARE
GIVEN IN UPPER CASE BECAUSE THAT IS THE
DEFAULT cOMMODORE bASIC STARTUP MODE.
cOMMODORE dos EXPECTS LOWER CASE, SO
WHEN USING THIS COMMAND IN cHIcli, YOU
NEED TO USE LOWER CASE, AS IN THE 
EXAMPLE GIVEN BELOW. 

eXAMPLE:

dumpmem command

tHIS LET'S YOU DUMP AN AREA OF MEMORY
TO A FILE IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY 
YOU'RE IN. 

tHE FIRST ARGUMENT IS THE STARTING
LOCATION IN MEMORY EXPRESSED AS A
DECIMAL NUMBER. 

tHE SECOND IS THE ENDING ADDRESS IN
MEMORY.

tHE FINAL ARGUMENT IS THE NAME OF THE
FILE THAT SHOULD BE USED TO SAVE THE
BYTES READ FROM MEMORY.

hERE'S AN EXAMPLE:
DUMP-MEM 1000 2000 MEMORY.BIN

hOWEVER, THERE IS ALSO A SHORTCUT,
FOR SITUATION WHEN YOU WANT TO
SAVE THE CONTENT OF YOUR KERNAL OR
basic romS. uSE "ROM" WITHOUT 
QUOTE FOR THE FIRST ARGUMENT, AND
EITHER "KERNAL" OR "BASIC" FOR 
THE SECOND ARGUMENT. tHE THIRD
ARGUMENT IS STILL THE FILE NAME.

hERE'S AN EXAMPLE:
DUMP-MEM ROM KERNAL KERNAL.ROM
---------------------------------------
echo command

dISPLAYS THE TEXT AS THE FIRST
ARGUMENT. yOU CAN ALSO USE QUOTES
AROUND THE TEXT YOU WANT ECHOED.

tHIS EXITS cHIcli.

eXAMPLE: EXIT
---------------------------------------
filedate command

iF YOU HAVE AN sd2iec, IT IS CAPABLE
OF DISPLAYING TIME STAMPS FOR A GIVEN
FILE. tHIS COMMAND SHOWS YOU A TIME
STAMP FOR THE FILE GIVEN, AS IT HAS
BEEN RECORDED ON THE fat32 sd CARD.
iF YOU DON'T HAVE A rtc INSTALLED ON
YOUR sd2iec, THEN ANY FILES SAVED
BY THE sd2iec ITSELF WHILE USING A
cOMMODORE 64 WILL NOT HAVE ACCURATE
TIME STAMPS. hOWEVER, ANY FILES SAVED
ON THE sd BY A DEVICE WITH A CLOCK
THAT'S SET CORRECTLY WILL HAVE THE
CORRECT TIME FOR WHEN THE FILE WAS
LAST MODIFIED.

aDDITIONALLY, IF YOUR sd2iec HAS THE
SOFTWARE CLOCK ENABLED, AND THE TIME
AND DATE HAVE BEEN SET SINCE IT WAS
POWERED ON, THEN IT MAY BE POSSIBLE
TO SAVE FILES WITH THE CORRECT TIME
STAMP INFORMATION AS WELL.

pLEASE NOTE, AS OF THE WRITING OF THIS
DOCUMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE YOUR MODERN
COMPUTER OR DEVICE WILL SAVE THE TIME
STAMP INFORMATION IN utc AND THEN
LOCALLY DISPLAY THE TIME STAMPS
CORRECTLY FOR YOUR TIME ZONE. tHE
sd2iec WILL DISPLAY WHATEVER TIME
STAMP IS SAVED ON THE sd CARD, SO
THERE MAY BE A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN
THE SAVED TIME AND WHAT YOU EXPECTED.

aTTEMPTING TO ACCOUNT AND ADJUST FOR
THIS IS BEYOND THE CURRENT SCOPE OF
THIS PROGRAM, SINCE cHIcli HAS MOVED
ALL TIME AND DATE HANDLING TO THE
sd2iec DEVICE EXCLUSIVELY.
