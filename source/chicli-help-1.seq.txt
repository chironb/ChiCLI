_DISKCOPY

This lets you execute a custom command
intended for a Commodore DOS device.

DOS Command:
Passes the given string directly to
the Commodore DOS device, using
channel 1.

Note: Commodore DOS commands
*appear* to be in upper case because
that is the default Basic startup mode.
However DOS expects lower case.
When using this command, you need to
use lower case, as in the example
given below.

Note: Use quotes if there's spaces in
the command string you want to send.

Example:
dos "v0"

_DRVDETECT

Gets the drive name string from the
current device.

_DRVSET
DRVSET
Usage: drvset [DEVICE]

Changes the drive number of the
current drive, which is automatically
detected and the right method is used
if the drive is supported. For the
SD2IEC, you can use the sd2iec -save
command to make this permanent.

Device: The new device number for
the current device.

Currently supported drives:
  1541  sd-2
  1570  sd2iec
  1571  cmd hd
  1581

_DUMPMEM
DUMPMEM
Usage: dumpmem [START] [END] [FILE]

This let's you dump an area of memory
to a file in the current directory 
you're in.

used.

End: Ending address in memory.
The shortcut 'kernal' can also be
used with the 'rom' shortcut.

File: File name for the saved bytes 
read from memory.

Example: dump-mem 100 200 memory.bin
         dump-mem rom kernal kernalrom
