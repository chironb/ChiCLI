ChiCLI - Detailed Help
---------------------------------------
USER INTERFACE
---------------------------------------
Text Entry

ChiCLI uses custom routines to
manage the input and editing of text
on the command line. It automatically
inserts characters, and supports 
backspace and delete. It also supports
cursor keys and a home and end keys.

The Commodore cursor keys are supported
as well as extra keys to make it easier
for people who are coming from the
Linux or Windows keyboard layouts.

Note: 
DEL and HOME are treated the same.

CURSOR-LEFT CTRL+J - Cursor Left
CURSOR-LEFT CTRL+L - Cursor Right
CURSOR-UP   CTRL+I - Command History +
CURSOR-DOWN CTRL+K - Command History -

DEL CTRL+H         - Backspace
SHIFT+DEL CTRL+:   - Forward Delete

CTRL+U             - Start of Line
CTRL+O             - End of Line

CTRL+LEFT-ARROW    - Autocomplete

RUNSTOP CTRL+C     - Cancels
---------------------------------------
Command History

You can press CURSOR UP to go back into
a command history, and CURSOR DOWN to
forward in the command history.

Additionally, if you started typing a
command, it is stashed away as well,
so you can press CURSOR DOWN until
you return to the command you
originally started typing.

The system has a command history that
is five levels deep, plus the current
command that's been stashed. This means
you can you go back five commands worth
of commands in your command history.
---------------------------------------
Tab Completion

Commodore 64: Use CTRL+Left-Arrow

On the Commodore 64 there is no TAB 
key on the keyboard. The closest is the
LEFT ARROW key above the CTRL key at 
the far left of the keyboard. 

In order to enter a left arrow 
character, for example if you need to 
load a file name that contains the 
left arrow character, you can press:
LEFT ARROW 
to enter this character.

The tab completion will start searching
the current folder for files whose
beginning match the last string of 
text entered on the command line that's
separated by an empty space. 

Please note: I've made this way faster
now. However, if you have an SD2IEC 
with an enormous number of files, it's
going to take time to load each file 
name and compare it to the text you're
trying to auto-complete.
---------------------------------------
Change to Next Device CTRL+D

This was created for people who are
used to using JiffyDOS's built-in
shortcut to change drives using the
keyboard shortcut CTRL+D.

Press CTRL+D will move you into the
next device that's currently detected.
If there are no higher device numbers,
it will automatically switch to the
lowest detected device number.

Remember to release the CTRL key after
you've used this shortcut, as the C64
kernal pauses while the CTRL key is
currently being held down.
---------------------------------------
Hotkeys

Hotkey manages the ability to assign
command strings to the function keys.

Examples:
hotkey                  - Lists hotkeys
hotkey 1 "echo Hi!"     - Assigns F1
hotkey 2 ls             - Assigns F2
hotkey 1 -clear         - Clears F1
hotkey -clear           - Clears all

You can also do something a little more
complex like this: 

hotkey 1 = "echo ;ChiCLI Rules!;"

The semi-colon is automatically 
substituted for quotes when the system
processes the echo command. 
---------------------------------------
Aliases

Alias managed the aliasing system. You
can set your own, clear them, or clear
all of the aliases. 

There are a number of pre-configured 
aliases already set, based on commands
from Commodore DOS, AmigaDOS, MS-DOS,
and Linux.

alias                 - Lists aliases
alias hi "echo Hi!"   - Sets an alias
alias vm view-mem     - Sets an alias
alias vm -clear       - Clears an alias
alias -clear          - Clears all

alias cr = "echo ;ChiCLI Rules!;"

The semi-colon is automatically 
substituted for quotes when the system
processes the echo command.
---------------------------------------
Arguments

ChiCLI supports arguments passed by
Commodore Basic.

It uses the following format:
RUN:REM ARG1 "ARG2 QUOTED" ARG3 "" ARG5

Supported options:

Disable Drive Detect: -ddd

This disabled drive detection. This is
also disabled once you change drive 
numbers in software. In the future, 
this will be addressed differently. 

Example:
LOAD"CHICLI",8
RUN:REM -DDD

Skip Title: -skiptitle or -st

This skips the hardware screen gets 
you to the prompt faster. This is also 
created for external programs that are 
launched from it and then re-load and 
re-run it, created a more seamless 
experience. 

Example from Basic:
LOAD"CHICLI",8
RUN:REM -ST

Example from within ChiCLI:
./chicli -st
run chicli -st
