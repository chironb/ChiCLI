Usage: run [PROG] [OPTION1] [OPTION2]

This loads and runs a command after
exiting the ChiCLI system.

Prog: Name of the program to run.

Option1:
   Nothing or -1  Uses: LOAD"GO",8,1
              -0  Uses: LOAD"GO",8,0
              -t  Uses: SYS8*4096
 *anything else*  Sends as argument

Option2:  Sends as argument

Examples: run coolgame
          run super-program -0
          run turbomacropro -t

_SS
SS
Usage: ss [OPTIONS]

Displays a moving logo screensaver
with the date and time if used with
an SD2IEC only if a SD2IEC software
or RTC clock is detected.

Options:
You can also enable or disable whether
the date and/or time is displayed.
Additionally, you can display the
CPU temperature instead.
  -et  Enables time display.
  -dd  Enables date display.
  -dt  Disables time display.
  -dd  Disables time display.
  -te  Temperature enable display.

Examples:   ss
            ss -dd

_SHUTDOWN
SHUTDOWN
Usage: shutdown

This exits the program and displays
a message letting you know it's safe
to turn off your Commodore.

_SPEED
SPEED
Usage: speed [OPTIONS]

This commands runs a payload of NOP
instructions and estimates the speed
in MHz of the current processor. It
displays the speed in MHz and also
can show the number of raster scan
lines it took for the NOP payload to
execute. For the SuperCPU it shows the
currently set processor speed. For the
C128 it shows the maximum CPU speed
even though it's running in C64 mode.

Option: passing -d will show some
debugging information.

Please note: This is an estimate, and
for crazy fast systems above 20 MHz
it will probably not report that
exact speed in MHz.

_STATUS
STATUS
Usage: status [OPTIONS]

This retrives the status of the
current drive.

Option: Passing the drive number will
show you the status for that device.

Example: status
         status d08:

_STOPWATCH
STOPWATCH
Usage: stopwatch

The "stopwatch" command starts when
you run it, and when run again, stops
and outputs the elapsed minutes and
seconds since it was last called.
It resets on the second call as well.
The maximum time:
  59:59.9 minutes:seconds.deciseconds

Example: stopwatch

_SUPERCPU
SuperCPU
Usage: supercpu [OPTION]

This determines if the SuperCPU is
enabled when possible, or disabled
all the time. The SuperCPU is always
disabled for disk access.

Option: 
  -t  Turbo Enabled
  -n  Normal Mode (Turbo Disabled)

Example: supercpu -t

_SYS
SYS
Usage: sys [ADDRESS]

This causes execution to jump to the
memory location given. It expects a
number in decimal. This works just
like the Commodore Basic command.

Address: The address where you want
the processor to begin execution.

Note: This will probably bork the
currently running ChiCLI. Use with
caution.

Example: sys 64738

_SYSINFO
SYSINFO
Usage: sysinfo

A neofetch inspired display, that
attempts to detect the hardware in
your standard C64 and displays info
about your system. It also plays a
sound based on the chirp used on the
Commodore PET and Commodore PC.

It will also detect if the system
is running under emulation under
VICE as well as TheC64.

_TEMP
TEMP
Usage: temp

This using special programming and
mapping curves to display the
current temperature of the CPU
without any additional hardware.

Works only on original C64s and C64Cs,
with the C64C having approx. +/- 2'C
accuracy, and for the C64 having
approx +/- 1'C accuracy.

Option: passing -d will show some
debugging information.

_TIME
TIME
Usage: time [OPTIONS]

Displays the current time.

To set the date and time use the
command datetime with the
parameter "-set".

_TYPE
TYPE
Usage: type [FILE NAME] [OPTIONS]

This is a file viewer. It can display
files in the formats SEQ, PRG, or any
other type of file. It attempts to
auto-detect the file type and shows
the relevant output, such as:
Text view -> SEQ files
Program view -> BASIC PRG files
Hex view -> Machine language PRG files

File Name: File name you want to view.

Options: -text  Forces text view.
         -hex   Forces hex view.

Example:
type chicli

Usage: sd2iec [OPTIONS]

A command for SD2IEC specific
functions.

Options:
-hide-ext  Hide files ending in
Commodore DOS extensions, such as
.prg or .seq, and instead reports
them to the system as if they were
that type of file.

-show-ext  The opposite of -hide-ext,
where it shows all file names as-is
and as if they were PRG files.

-save  Saves the current settings to
the SD2IEC, for example after changing
the device number.

_UNALIAS
