Usage: @[DOS COMMAND]

This lets you execute a custom command
intended for a Commodore DOS device.
This is similar to the "dos" command,
however, this version differs in that:
- There is no space between the @
  and the command.
- There is no prompt asking if
  you are sure you want to execute
  the command.

This is intended for people used to
JiffyDOS, however, all it does is
pass whatever is after @ as a command.

Please see the "dos" command for more
information.

Note: *DO NOT* use quotes, as this
command grabs the entire remainder
of the command string.

Example: @v0

_$
$
Usage: $[OPTIONS]

This is intended for people used to
