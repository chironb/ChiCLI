INTERFACESTHAT DO NOT DISPLAY aPPROPRIATE lEGALnOTICES, YOUR WORK NEED NOT MAKE THEMDO SO.a COMPILATION OF A COVERED WORK WITHOTHER SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT WORKS,WHICH ARE NOT BY THEIR NATUREEXTENSIONS OF THE COVERED WORK, ANDWHICH ARE NOT COMBINED WITH IT SUCH ASTO FORM A LARGER PROGRAM, IN OR ON AVOLUME OF A STORAGE OR DISTRIBUTIONMEDIUM, IS CALLED AN "AGGREGATE" IF THECOMPILATION AND ITS RESULTING COPYRIGHTARE NOT USED TO LIMIT THE ACCESS ORLEGAL RIGHTS OF THE COMPILATION'S USERSBEYOND WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL WORKSPERMIT.  iNCLUSION OF A COVERED WORK INAN AGGREGATE DOES NOT CAUSE THISlICENSE TO APPLY TO THE OTHER PARTS OFTHE AGGREGATE.6. cONVEYING nON-sOURCE fORMS.yOU MAY CONVEY A COVERED WORK IN OBJECTCODE FORM UNDER THE TERMS OF SECTIONS 4AND

THEcORRESPONDING sOURCE ALONG WITH THEOBJECT CODE.  iF THE PLACE TO COPY THEOBJECT CODE IS A NETWORK SERVER, THEcORRESPONDING sOURCE MAY BE ON ADIFFERENT SERVER (OPERATED BY YOU OR ATHIRD PARTY) THAT SUPPORTS EQUIVALENTCOPYING FACILITIES, PROVIDED YOUMAINTAIN CLEAR DIRECTIONS NEXT TO THEOBJECT CODE SAYING WHERE TO FIND THEcORRESPONDING sOURCE.  rEGARDLESS OFWHAT SERVER HOSTS THE cORRESPONDINGsOURCE, YOU REMAIN OBLIGATED TO ENSURETHAT IT IS AVAILABLE FOR AS LONG ASNEEDED TO SATISFY THESE REQUIREMENTS.E) cONVEY THE OBJECT CODE USINGPEER-TO-PEER TRANSMISSION, PROVIDED YOUINFORM OTHER PEERS WHERE THE OBJECTCODE AND cORRESPONDING sOURCE OF THEWORK ARE BEING OFFERED TO THE GENERALPUBLIC AT NO CHARGE UNDER SUBSECTION6D.a SEPARABLE PORTION OF THE OBJECT

WHETHER APRODUCT IS A CONSUMER PRODUCT, DOUBTFULCASES SHALL BE RESOLVED IN FAVOR OFCOVERAGE.  fOR A PARTICULAR PRODUCTRECEIVED BY A PARTICULAR USER,"NORMALLY USED" REFERS TO A TYPICAL ORCOMMON USE OF THAT CLASS OF PRODUCT,REGARDLESS OF THE STATUS OF THEPARTICULAR USER OR OF THE WAY IN WHICHTHE PARTICULAR USER ACTUALLY USES, OREXPECTS OR IS EXPECTED TO USE, THEPRODUCT.  a PRODUCT IS A

THAT uSER pRODUCT FROM AMODIFIED VERSION OF ITS cORRESPONDINGsOURCE.  tHE INFORMATION MUST SUFFICETO ENSURE THAT THE CONTINUEDFUNCTIONING OF THE MODIFIED OBJECT CODEIS IN NO CASE PREVENTED OR INTERFEREDWITH SOLELY BECAUSE MODIFICATION HASBEEN MADE.iF YOU CONVEY AN OBJECT CODE WORK UNDERTHIS SECTION IN, OR WITH, ORSPECIFICALLY FOR USE IN, A uSERpRODUCT, AND THE CONVEYING OCCURS ASPART OF A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THERIGHT OF POSSESSION AND USE OF THE uSERpRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RECIPIENTIN PERPETUITY OR FOR A FIXED TERM(REGARDLESS OF HOW THE TRANSACTION ISCHARACTERIZED), THE cORRESPONDINGsOURCE CONVEYED UNDER THIS SECTION MUSTBE ACCOMPANIED BY THE iNSTALLATIONiNFORMATION.  bUT THIS REQUIREMENT DOESNOT APPLY IF NEITHER YOU NOR ANY THIRDPARTY

AREQUIREMENT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDESUPPORT SERVICE, WARRANTY, OR UPDATESFOR A WORK THAT HAS BEEN MODIFIED ORINSTALLED BY THE RECIPIENT, OR FOR THEuSER pRODUCT IN WHICH IT HAS BEENMODIFIED OR INSTALLED.  aCCESS TO ANETWORK MAY BE DENIED WHEN THEMODIFICATION ITSELF MATERIALLY ANDADVERSELY AFFECTS THE OPERATION OF THENETWORK OR VIOLATES THE RULES ANDPROTOCOLS FOR COMMUNICATION ACROSS THENETWORK.cORRESPONDING sOURCE CONVEYED, ANDiNSTALLATION iNFORMATION PROVIDED, INACCORD WITH THIS SECTION MUST BE IN AFORMAT THAT IS PUBLICLY DOCUMENTED (ANDWITH AN IMPLEMENTATION AVAILABLE TO

REMAINS GOVERNED BYTHIS lICENSE WITHOUT REGARD TO THEADDITIONAL PERMISSIONS.wHEN YOU CONVEY A COPY OF A COVEREDWORK, YOU MAY AT YOUR OPTION REMOVE ANYADDITIONAL PERMISSIONS FROM THAT COPY,OR FROM ANY PART OF IT.  (aDDITIONALPERMISSIONS MAY BE WRITTEN TO REQUIRETHEIR OWN REMOVAL IN CERTAIN CASES WHENYOU MODIFY THE WORK.)  yOU MAY PLACEADDITIONAL PERMISSIONS ON MATERIAL,ADDED BY YOU TO A COVERED WORK,

iF THE pROGRAM AS YOURECEIVED IT, OR ANY PART OF IT,CONTAINS A NOTICE STATING THAT IT ISGOVERNED BY THIS lICENSE ALONG WITH ATERM THAT IS A FURTHER RESTRICTION, YOUMAY REMOVE THAT TERM.  iF A LICENSEDOCUMENT CONTAINS A FURTHER RESTRICTIONBUT PERMITS RELICENSING OR CONVEYINGUNDER THIS lICENSE, YOU MAY ADD TO ACOVERED WORK MATERIAL GOVERNED BY THETERMS OF THAT LICENSE DOCUMENT,PROVIDED THAT THE FURTHER RESTRICTIONDOES NOT SURVIVE SUCH RELICENSING ORCONVEYING.iF YOU ADD TERMS TO A COVERED WORK INACCORD WITH THIS SECTION, YOU MUSTPLACE, IN THE RELEVANT SOURCE FILES, ASTATEMENT OF THE ADDITIONAL TERMS THATAPPLY TO THOSE FILES, OR A NOTICEINDICATING WHERE TO FIND THE APPLICABLETERMS.aDDITIONAL TERMS, PERMISSIVE ORNON-PERMISSIVE, MAY BE STATED IN THEFORM OF A SEPARATELY WRITTEN LICENSE,OR STATED AS EXCEPTIONS; THE ABOVEREQUIREMENTS APPLY EITHER WAY.8. tERMINATION.yOU MAY NOT PROPAGATE OR MODIFY ACOVERED WORK EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLYPROVIDED UNDER THIS lICENSE.  aNYATTEMPT OTHERWISE TO PROPAGATE ORMODIFY IT IS VOID, AND WILLAUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE YOUR RIGHTSUNDER THIS lICENSE (INCLUDING ANYPATENT LICENSES GRANTED UNDER THE THIRDPARAGRAPH OF SECTION 11).hOWEVER, IF YOU CEASE ALL VIOLATION OFTHIS lICENSE, THEN YOUR LICENSE FROM APARTICULAR COPYRIGHT HOLDER ISREINSTATED (A) PROVISIONALLY, UNLESSAND UNTIL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDEREXPLICITLY AND FINALLY TERMINATES YOURLICENSE, AND (B) PERMANENTLY, IF THECOPYRIGHT HOLDER FAILS TO NOTIFY YOU OFTHE VIOLATION BY SOME REASONABLE MEANSPRIOR TO 60 DAYS AFTER THE CESSATION.mOREOVER, YOUR LICENSE FROM APARTICULAR COPYRIGHT HOLDER ISREINSTATED PERMANENTLY IF THE COPYRIGHTHOLDER NOTIFIES YOU OF THE VIOLATION BYSOME REASONABLE MEANS, THIS IS THEFIRST TIME YOU HAVE RECEIVED NOTICE OFVIOLATION OF THIS lICENSE (FOR ANYWORK) FROM THAT COPYRIGHT HOLDER, ANDYOU CURE THE VIOLATION PRIOR TO 30 DAYSAFTER YOUR RECEIPT OF THE NOTICE.tERMINATION OF YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THISSECTION DOES NOT TERMINATE THE LICENSESOF PARTIES WHO HAVE RECEIVED COPIES ORRIGHTS FROM YOU UNDER THIS lICENSE.  iFYOUR RIGHTS HAVE BEEN TERMINATED ANDNOT PERMANENTLY REINSTATED, YOU DO NOTQUALIFY TO RECEIVE NEW LICENSES FOR THESAME MATERIAL UNDER SECTION 10.9. aCCEPTANCE nOT rEQUIRED FOR hAVINGcOPIES.yOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO ACCEPT THISlICENSE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE OR RUN ACOPY OF THE pROGRAM.  aNCILLARYPROPAGATION OF A COVERED WORK OCCURRINGSOLELY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF USINGPEER-TO-PEER TRANSMISSION TO RECEIVE ACOPY LIKEWISE DOES NOT REQUIREACCEPTANCE.  hOWEVER, NOTHING OTHERTHAN THIS lICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSIONTO PROPAGATE OR MODIFY ANY COVEREDWORK.  tHESE ACTIONS INFRINGE COPYRIGHTIF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS lICENSE. tHEREFORE, BY MODIFYING OR PROPAGATINGA COVERED WORK, YOU INDICATE YOURACCEPTANCE OF THIS lICENSE TO DO SO.10. aUTOMATIC lICENSING OF dOWNSTREAMrECIPIENTS.eACH TIME YOU CONVEY A COVERED WORK,THE RECIPIENT AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVES ALICENSE FROM THE ORIGINAL LICENSORS, TORUN, MODIFY AND PROPAGATE THAT WORK,SUBJECT TO THIS lICENSE.  yOU ARE NOTRESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING COMPLIANCE BYTHIRD PARTIES WITH THIS lICENSE.aN "ENTITY TRANSACTION" IS ATRANSACTION TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF ANORGANIZATION, OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALLASSETS OF ONE, OR SUBDIVIDING ANORGANIZATION, OR MERGING ORGANIZATIONS. iF PROPAGATION OF A COVERED WORKRESULTS FROM AN ENTITY TRANSACTION,EACH PARTY TO THAT TRANSACTION WHORECEIVES A COPY OF THE WORK ALSORECEIVES WHATEVER LICENSES TO THE WORKTHE PARTY'S PREDECESSOR IN INTEREST HADOR COULD GIVE UNDER THE PREVIOUSPARAGRAPH, PLUS A RIGHT TO POSSESSIONOF THE cORRESPONDING sOURCE OF THE WORKFROM THE PREDECESSOR IN INTEREST, IFTHE PREDECESSOR HAS IT OR CAN GET ITWITH REASONABLE EFFORTS.yOU MAY NOT IMPOSE ANY FURTHERRESTRICTIONS ON THE EXERCISE OF THERIGHTS GRANTED OR AFFIRMED UNDER THISlICENSE.  fOR EXAMPLE, YOU MAY NOTIMPOSE A LICENSE FEE, ROYALTY, OR OTHERCHARGE FOR

SELLING,OFFERING FOR SALE, OR IMPORTING THEpROGRAM OR ANY PORTION OF IT.11. pATENTS.a "CONTRIBUTOR" IS A COPYRIGHT HOLDERWHO AUTHORIZES USE UNDER THIS lICENSEOF THE pROGRAM OR A WORK ON WHICH THEpROGRAM IS BASED.  tHE WORK THUSLICENSED IS CALLED THE CONTRIBUTOR'S"CONTRIBUTOR VERSION".a CONTRIBUTOR'S "ESSENTIAL PATENTCLAIMS" ARE ALL PATENT CLAIMS OWNED ORCONTROLLED BY THE CONTRIBUTOR, WHETHERALREADY ACQUIRED OR HEREAFTER ACQUIRED,THAT WOULD BE INFRINGED BY SOME MANNER,PERMITTED BY THIS lICENSE, OF MAKING,USING, OR SELLING ITS CONTRIBUTORVERSION, BUT DO NOT INCLUDE

USE,SELL, OFFER FOR SALE, IMPORT ANDOTHERWISE RUN, MODIFY AND PROPAGATE THECONTENTS OF ITS CONTRIBUTOR VERSION.iN THE FOLLOWING THREE PARAGRAPHS, A"PATENT LICENSE" IS ANY EXPRESSAGREEMENT OR COMMITMENT, HOWEVERDENOMINATED, NOT TO ENFORCE A PATENT(SUCH AS AN EXPRESS PERMISSION TOPRACTICE A PATENT OR COVENANT NOT TOSUE FOR PATENT INFRINGEMENT).  tO"GRANT" SUCH A PATENT LICENSE TO APARTY MEANS TO MAKE SUCH AN AGREEMENTOR COMMITMENT NOT TO ENFORCE A PATENTAGAINST THE PARTY.iF YOU CONVEY A COVERED WORK, KNOWINGLYRELYING ON A PATENT LICENSE, AND THEcORRESPONDING sOURCE OF THE WORK IS NOTAVAILABLE FOR ANYONE TO COPY, FREE OFCHARGE AND UNDER THE TERMS OF THISlICENSE, THROUGH A PUBLICLY AVAILABLENETWORK SERVER OR OTHER READILYACCESSIBLE MEANS, THEN YOU MUST EITHER(1) CAUSE THE cORRESPONDING sOURCE TOBE SO AVAILABLE, OR (2) ARRANGE TODEPRIVE YOURSELF OF THE BENEFIT OF THEPATENT LICENSE FOR THIS PARTICULARWORK, OR (3) ARRANGE, IN A MANNERCONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OFTHIS lICENSE, TO EXTEND THE PATENTLICENSE TO DOWNSTREAM RECIPIENTS. "kNOWINGLY RELYING" MEANS YOU HAVEACTUAL KNOWLEDGE THAT, BUT FOR THEPATENT LICENSE, YOUR CONVEYING THECOVERED WORK IN A COUNTRY, OR YOURRECIPIENT'S USE OF THE COVERED WORK INA COUNTRY, WOULD INFRINGE ONE OR MOREIDENTIFIABLE PATENTS IN THAT COUNTRYTHAT YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE AREVALID.iF, PURSUANT TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH ASINGLE TRANSACTION OR ARRANGEMENT, YOUCONVEY, OR PROPAGATE BY PROCURINGCONVEYANCE OF, A COVERED WORK, ANDGRANT A PATENT LICENSE TO SOME OF THEPARTIES RECEIVING THE COVERED WORKAUTHORIZING THEM TO USE, PROPAGATE,MODIFY OR CONVEY A SPECIFIC COPY OF THECOVERED WORK, THEN THE PATENT LICENSEYOU GRANT IS AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED TOALL RECIPIENTS OF THE COVERED WORK ANDWORKS BASED ON IT.a PATENT LICENSE IS "DISCRIMINATORY" IFIT DOES NOT INCLUDE WITHIN THE SCOPE OFITS COVERAGE, PROHIBITS THE EXERCISEOF, OR IS CONDITIONED ON THENON-EXERCISE OF ONE OR MORE OF THERIGHTS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY GRANTEDUNDER THIS lICENSE.  yOU MAY NOT CONVEYA COVERED WORK IF YOU ARE A PARTY TO ANARRANGEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY THAT ISIN THE BUSINESS OF DISTRIBUTINGSOFTWARE, UNDER WHICH YOU MAKE PAYMENTTO THE THIRD PARTY BASED ON THE EXTENTOF YOUR ACTIVITY OF CONVEYING THE WORK,AND UNDER WHICH THE THIRD PARTY GRANTS,TO ANY OF THE PARTIES WHO WOULD RECEIVETHE COVERED WORK FROM YOU, ADISCRIMINATORY PATENT LICENSE (A) INCONNECTION WITH COPIES OF THE COVEREDWORK CONVEYED BY YOU (OR COPIES MADEFROM THOSE COPIES), OR (B) PRIMARILYFOR AND IN CONNECTION WITH SPECIFICPRODUCTS OR COMPILATIONS THAT CONTAINTHE COVERED WORK, UNLESS YOU ENTEREDINTO THAT ARRANGEMENT, OR THAT PATENTLICENSE WAS GRANTED, PRIOR TO 28 mARCH2007.nOTHING IN THIS lICENSE SHALL BECONSTRUED AS EXCLUDING OR LIMITING ANYIMPLIED LICENSE OR OTHER DEFENSES TOINFRINGEMENT THAT MAY OTHERWISE BEAVAILABLE TO YOU UNDER APPLICABLEPATENT LAW.12. nO sURRENDER OF
